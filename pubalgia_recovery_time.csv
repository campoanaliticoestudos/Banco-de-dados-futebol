34564192,Stretching for Recovery from Groin Pain or Injury in Athletes: A Critical and Systematic Review.,"Stretching is usually used as part of rehabilitation protocols for groin pain or injury, but its specific contribution to and within multimodal recovery protocols is unclear. Our goal was to systematically review the effects of stretching for the recovery from groin pain or injury. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, with eligibility criteria defined according to PICOS: (Participants) athletes with groin pain or injuries; (Interventions) interventions with stretching as the differentiating factor; (Comparators) comparators not applying stretching; (Outcomes) symptom remission or improvement and/or time to return to sport and/or return to play; (Study design) randomized controlled trials. Searches were performed on 26 March 2021, in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, EMBASE, PEDro, PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science, with no limitations regarding language or date, and no filters. Of 117 retrieved results, 65 were duplicates and 49 were excluded at the screening stage. The three articles eligible for full-text analysis failed to comply with one or more inclusion criteria (participants, intervention and/or comparators). We then went beyond the protocol and searched for non-randomized trials and case series, but no intervention was found where stretching was the differentiating factor. We found no trials specifically assessing the effects of stretching on recovery or improvement of groin pain or injury in athletes. Currently, the efficacy of these interventions is unknown, and more research is warranted.",2021,NA,
32438790,Operative treatment of athletic pubalgia in competitive athletes: a retrospective study.,"Athletic pubalgia is an obscure sport injury, presenting mainly with groin pain during twisting movements. The present 15 year study reports outcomes, intraoperative findings and complications of the endoscopic surgical treatment in competitive athletes. All competitive athletes, from 2004 to 2018, suffering from athletic pubalgia, treated with laparoscopic Total Extra-Peritoneal technique, at the Department of General, Laparoscopic, Oncologic and Robotic Surgery of the Athens Medical Center were included in this retrospective cohort. Postoperative pain, complications, return to previous training routine and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. A total of 130 patients (115; 88.5% males and 15; 11.5% females) with a mean age of 26.7±7.5 years were evaluated. Preoperatively, mean numeric scale pain was found to be 7.7±1.7. Three days postoperatively, the mean numeric pain scale was 3.4±1.5, showing 55.8% decrease. The mean time for return to sports activity was found to be 6.27±3.02 weeks. Regarding complications, six patients (4.6%) had slight numbness at the groin area during the first 6 postoperative months and one patient (0.8%) suffered from a postoperative hematoma. No recurrence was observed. At the final follow-up (mean 76.58±46.5 months), a total of 97 (74.7%) patients were very satisfied, 31 (23.8%) satisfied and two (1.5%) not satisfied with the outcome. Laparoscopic operative treatment in competitive athletes suffering from athletic pubalgia seems to offer rapid recovery, rapid return to sports, as well as very low complications rate and no recurrence.",2020,NA,
29549038,Athletic pubalgia: Return to play after targeted surgery.,"Surgery for athletic pubalgia usually consists in abdominal wall repair combined with routine bilateral adductor tenotomy. We currently confine the surgical procedure to the injured structure(s) (abdominal wall only, adductor tendon only, or both) to limit morbidity and expedite recovery. Outcomes of this à la carte approach are unclear. The objectives of this retrospective study were to determine the return to play (RTP) time, evaluate the potential influence of injury location, and assess the frequency of recurrence or contralateral involvement. À la carte surgery for athletic pubalgia is associated with similar RTP times as the conventional procedure and is not followed by recurrence. Consecutive adults younger than 40 years of age who underwent surgery for athletic pubalgia with injury to the abdominal wall and/or adductor attachment sites between 2009 and 2015 were included. Patients with intra-articular hip disorders, isolated pubic symphysis involvement, or herniation were not eligible. The diagnosis was established clinically then confirmed by at least one imaging technique (ultrasonography plus either a radiograph of the pelvis or magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis). The criterion for performing surgery was failure of appropriate conservative therapy followed for at least 3 months. Of the 27 included patients, eight had abdominal wall involvement only, seven adductor tendon involvement only, and 12 both. Overall, 25 (92.6%) patients returned to play at their previous level, after a mean of 112±38 days (range, 53-223 days), and experienced no recurrence during the 1-year follow-up. Mean RTP time was significantly shorter in the group with abdominal wall injury only (91.1±21.0 days) compared to the groups with adductor tendon injury only (101.7±42.0 days) or combined injuries (132.5±39.0) (p=0.02). In patients with athletic pubalgia, à la carte surgery confined to the injured structure(s) produces excellent RTP outcomes. RTP time is shortest in patients with isolated lower abdominal wall injuries. IV, retrospective study with no control group.",2018,NA,
26756855,Therapeutic results after ultrasound-guided intratissue percutaneous electrolysis (EPI®) in the treatment of rectus abdominis-related groin pain in professional footballers: a pilot study.,"Rectus abdominis-related groin pain (RAGP) is one of the possible clinical patterns that determine pubalgia. RAGP is one of the typical patterns in footballers and is due to the degeneration and tendinopathy of the distal tendon, at the level of the two pubic tubercles. Intratissue percutaneous electrolysis (EPI) is a novel technique used in the treatment of tendinopathies. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic benefits of EPI by contrasting the two basic components that characterize RAGP: painful symptoms and resultant functional deficits. Eight professional footballers at Udinese Calcio Spa Football Club underwent ultrasound-guided EPI intervention. No other type of treatment was combined with EPI. Pain was monitored with the Verbal Rating Scale, while functional deficit was monitored using the Patient Specific Functional Scale. The scales implementation took place before treatment, then 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months after the end of treatment. Treatment with EPI produced a complete reduction of pain symptoms in one month and enabled excellent functional recovery for walking and jogging in one week; for getting out of bed, running, jumping and kicking within one month from the end of the treatment. Treatment with ultrasound-guided EPI has shown encouraging clinical results for RAGP. Data are preliminary: considering the limitations of this study more complex design studies are necessary to test the efficacy of the technique. This study introduces the EPI technique for the first time in the treatment of professional footballers suffering from RAGP. Its future use is proposed as a treatment solution, including complementary to conservative treatment.",2016,NA,
25673359,Posterior symphyseal spurs--an unusual differential diagnosis in athletes with groin pain.,"We set out to highlight the significance of posterior symphyseal spurs as an unusual diagnostic possibility in athletes with chronic groin pain and to demonstrate that operative resection was successful in quickly and safely returning the patients to sporting activities. Five competitive nonprofessional male athletes, three soccer players, and two marathon runners (median age: 30 [26/33] years), who presented to us with significant groin and central pubic pain with duration of at least 12 months, and who had failed conservative or surgical interventions (symphyseal plating), were evaluated. Physical examination as well as pelvic radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of posterior symphyseal spurs. Four out of five athletes underwent complete resection of the spur. Size of spurs was 2.2 (1.3/2.9) cm (median) with four of them posterosuperiorly and one posterocentrally located. All of them had uneventful postoperative recovery period and were still pain-free at the latest follow up after 26.6 months (24/30). Median time-to-return to competitive sports level was 10 weeks (8/13). None of the patients developed pubic instability due to symphyseal spur resection. The results of considerable postoperative improvement in our patients highlight the significance of posterior symphyseal spurs as a diagnostic possibility in athletes with chronic groin pain.",2015,NA,
20063110,Minimal Repair technique of sportsmen's groin: an innovative open-suture repair to treat chronic inguinal pain.,"Sportsmen's groin, also known as sportsman's hernia, sports hernia, (athletic) pubalgia or athletic hernia, especially in professional sportsmen, is a difficult clinical problem, and may place an athlete's career at risk. It presents with acute or chronic inguinal pain exacerbated with physical activity. So far, the diagnostic criteria and treatment modalities are inconsistently described and there is no evidence-based consensus available to guide decision-making. We developed an innovative open suture repair, called the ""Minimal Repair"" technique. With this technique, the defect of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is not enlarged, the suture is nearly tension-free and the patient can, therefore, return to full training and athletic activity within the shortest time. In September 2008, we started a prospective cohort study to evaluate the outcome of patients undergoing operations under the Minimal Repair technique for sportsmen's groin. Between September 2008 and May 2009, 129 patients were included in the study and were questioned at entry and 4 weeks after the operation. The primary endpoints were time to complete freedom of pain and time to resumption of exercise and sport. Here, we present the results observed 4 weeks after operation under the Minimal Repair technique. At enrollment, all but three patients reported a significant restriction of physical activities due to severe groin pain (median duration of pain 142 days, interquartile range [IQR] 57-330 days). Four weeks after operation under the Minimal Repair technique, 96.1% had resumed training (median 7 days, IQR 5-14 days). At this time, there was a full return to pre-injury sports activity levels in 75.8% (median 18.5 days, IQR 11.75-28 days). Focusing on the group of professional athletes, 83.7% had returned to unrestricted sports activities (median 14 days, IQR 10-28 days). In this subgroup, the median time to complete pain relief was 14 days (IQR 6-28 days). The surgical treatment of sportsmen's groin is common practice when non-surgical treatment has failed over a period of 6 weeks or more. However, there is no evidence-based data on the type of treatment. A wide variety of techniques with and without mesh are being performed. So far, laparoscopic repair is believed to enable a faster recovery and return to unrestricted sports activities. Our results, however, show that the outcome after operation under the Minimal Repair technique is very fast, without exposing the patient to possible risks related to mesh insertion or laparoscopic procedures. The Minimal Repair technique is an effective and safe way to treat sportsmen's groin.",2010,NA,
